# FileCompressionCSharp

A simple file compression program developed in C# to efficiently compress and decompress files using standard compression algorithms.

## Project Overview

The `FileCompressionCSharp` project provides a straightforward implementation of file compression and decompression functionalities. It aims to offer an easy-to-use solution for handling file compression tasks within C# applications.

## Features

- **Compression Algorithms**: Utilizes standard algorithms to compress files effectively.
- **Decompression Support**: Allows for the decompression of files back to their original state.
- **Simple Interface**: Provides an intuitive API for integrating compression functionalities into applications.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly across different platforms supported by .NET.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following key components:

- **FileCompressionCSharp**: Contains the main application logic for file compression and decompression.
- **LogicLayer**: Implements the core business logic for compression algorithms.
- **LogicLayerAccessor**: Provides access to the logic layer, facilitating interaction with other components.
- **DataObjects**: Defines data models representing the structure of compressed files and related metadata.
- **UnitTesting**: Includes unit tests to validate the functionality and reliability of the application.
